## Description

The Simple Shell Project aims to deepen our understanding of shell programming by creating our own shell from scratch. Through this project, we explore crucial topics such as process management, system calls, file manipulation, and error handling. By developing our shell program, we gain insights into the intricate interactions between user commands and the underlying operating system.

## Key Features

- Implementation of a functional shell interpreter
- Utilization of system calls for effective process management
- In-depth experience in file manipulation and error handling
- Replication of essential functionalities found in the simple shell (sh)
- Display a user-friendly prompt and wait for command input.
- Prevent termination of the shell when Ctrl-C is pressed.
- Handle command separators (;) to execute multiple commands sequentially.
- Replace special variables ($? and $$) with relevant values.
- Effectively manage comments (#) for better code clarity.
- Support the exit feature and manage exit statuses.
- Support file input, allowing batch execution of commands from a file.
- Manage commands with arguments, enhancing versatility.
- Handle the "end of file" condition (Ctrl+D).
- Implement logical operators (&& and ||) for conditional execution.
- Handle "not found" errors when an executable isn't located.
- Integrate history functionality to recall previous commands.


## Language and Development

The project is exclusively developed using the C programming language.
